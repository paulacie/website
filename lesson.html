    <p><span>LESSON 1:</span> Introducation to ICT.</p><br>
    <b><p>What is Information and Communication Technolgy?</p><br></b>
    <p>ICT is the technology required for information processing, in particular, the
      use of electronic computers, communication devices and software
      applications to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve
      information from anywhere, anytime.</p><br>

    <b><p>INFORMATION</p></b>
    <p>Information refers to the knowledge obtained from reading, investigation,
      study or research.The tools to transmit information are the telephone, television and radio.
      Information is knowledge and helps us to fulfill our daily tasks.</p><br>
    
    <b><p>Communication</p></b>
    <p>Communication is important in order to gain knowledge. With knowledge, we
      are more confident in expressing our thoughts and ideas.</p><br>

    <b><p>Technology</p></b>
    <p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge, experience
      and resources to create processes and products that fulfill
      human needs. Technology is vital in communication.</p><br>

    <p><span>LESSON 2:</span> Basic Computer Concept</p><br>
    <b><p>What is Computer? </p><br></b>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that accepts data from the user, processes it, produces
      results, displays them to the users, and stores the results for future usage.
      A computer is capable of calculating and storing results.Computer performs the following function:
    Input, Processing and Output.</p><br>

    <br>

    <b><p>Input</p></b>
    <p>An input is data that is entered into or received by a computer. This could include a user pressing a key on a keyboard, 
      clicking a mouse to select something on screen or tapping a touch pad. Some inputs indicate to the computer what we want it to do,
      while others provide data for the computer to process.</p><br>
    
    <b><p>Processing</p></b>
    <p>It perform by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It is the process of converting
      input into output.</p><br>

    <b><p>Output</p></b>
    <p>Any information processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered output. </p><br>

    <p><span>LESSON 3:</span> Evolution of Computer.</p><br>
    <b><p>How computer evolve?</p><br></b>
    <p>Although computers seem like a relatively modern invention, computing dates back to the early 1800s. 
      Throughout computing history, there has not been a lone inventor or a single first computer. 
      The invention of the computer was incremental, with dozens of scientists and mathematicians building on their predecessors.
      The modern computer, however, can be traced back to the 1930s.</p><br>

    <p><span>LESSON 4:</span> Parts of Computer.</p><br>
    <b><p>What are the parts of the computer?</p><br></b>
    <p>A peripheral device provides input/output (I/O) functions for a computer.
      Divide into two categories: Input, and Output Devices
    </p><br>

    <b><p>INPUT DEVICES</p></b>
    <p>Input devices convert incoming instructions or actions from the user into viable information that can be interpreted by the computer. </p><br>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <li>Keyboard</li>
    <li>Scanner</li>
    <li>Webcam</li>
    <li>Joystick</li>
    <li>Microphone</li>
    <li>Touchscreen</li>
    <li>Barcode Reader</li>
    <br>

    <b><p>Output Devices</p></b>
    <p>Output peripherals translate digital signals into information that can be interpreted or utilized by the end user.</p><br>
    <li>Speaker</li>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Printer</li>
    <li>Headphone</li>
    <li>Projector</li>

    <p><span>LESSON 5:</span> Motherboard.</p><br>
    <b><p>What is motherboard?</p><br></b>
    <p>A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. 
      The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material, typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet. 
      These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components. In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components.</p><br>

    <b><p>Types of motherboard</p></b>
    <p>As computers advanced, so have motherboards. Below is a list of the various motherboard form factors and additional information about each, including ATX, which is the most common.</p><br>
    <li>AT/FULL AT</li>
    <li>ATX/FULL ATX</li>
    <li>BABY AT</li>
    <li>BTX</li>
    <li>DTX</li>
    <li>LPX</li>
